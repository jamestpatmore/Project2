## Description 
DevTek an ECOMM MVC application (utilizing handlebars.js) with social media/blog adaption for the ultimate developer community. Account creation and storage is also a huge factor to get this savvy app running properly. Sleek design and a modern approach to the ever-growing tech empire.

## User Story 
```md 
AS A USER I want to find products that cater towards my tech lifestyle and career 
I WANT to be able to share my opinions regarding trending tech products with other people
I ALSO WANT my opinions to be heard 
WHILE having a retail aspect within the application as well.
```
## Installation 
This is a full stack application so it is running 

```md
npm start
```
In the projects directory but you can also visit the deployed heroku url [here](


With that being said I will go one by one with the proper dependency installations that must take place :old_key:

Express 
```md
npm i express
```

Dotenv
```md
npm i dotenv
```

Sequelize
``md
npm i sequelize
```

Handlebars.js
```md
npm install handlebars
Masonry 
```md
npm install masonary-layout 
```

##Future Development 
This application is amazing and we feel accomplished to be able to get it to this level within 2 weeks. However there are some components that will be a work in progress. 

Stay tuned for updates as I’ll be adding onto this project for my portfolio
